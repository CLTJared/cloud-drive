# Google Drive Clone - CLT Cloud
This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

We are creating a Google Drive clone that is typesafe and utilizing modern technologies.

## Technologies Used
Below are listed various technologies and other useful documents/etc that were used in the making of this application.

### T3 Stack - Typesafe From The Start
The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) was developed to use NextJS and be typesafe from the start. It utilizes the following:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

    - Video tutorial making of a Google Drive clone
- [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)
    - Rapid development of interface using AI

## What I Learned
- v0 is a very powerful way to quickly create UI elements and features for testing.
- TODO list in README can help keep track of new features added and make sure you're regularly checking and updating your documentation.
- Using a service like Netlify to have constant running deploys can help troubleshoot build process regularly and make sure you're not only working locally.
